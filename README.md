Z-Buffer 3D Avanzado

Repository at: https://github.com/PRZurro/Z-Buffer-Cpp

Extract the executables .zip in root folder or build the VS project changing in main the assets folder location. 

Release build seems not to work with relative paths, sometimes works and much more fluid than the debug version.

Model with several meshes seems not to work.
